# HPC4 Event logs DATA
HPC4 Event logs DATA for Five HPC systems with 512 to 131072 processors
System:	Five HPC systems with 512 to 131072 processors
Duration:	Between 215 and 558 days in 2004 - 2006
Data Type:	Event logs

## ABOUT THE DATA:
For a detailed description of the data see the DSN'07 paper by Adam Oliner and Jon Stearley. Below follows a very brief summary. The data consists of five event logs collected between 2004 and 2006 on five different supercomputing systems: Blue Gene/L, Thunderbird, RedStorm, Spirit, and Liberty. The logs contain alert and non-alert messages identified by alert category tags, and are therefore more amenable to alert detection and prediction research than failure modeling. All five systems are ranked on the Top500 Supercomputers List as of June 2006, spanning a range from #1 to #445. They vary by two orders of magnitude in the number of processors (ranging from 512 proccesors in Liberty to 131072 processors in Blue Gene/L) and by one order of magnitude in the amount of main memory The various machines are produced by IBM, Dell, Cray and HP. All systems are installed at Sandia National Labs (SNL) in Albuquerque, NM, with the exception of BG/L, which is at Lawrence Livermore National Labs (LLNL) in Livermore, CA.
